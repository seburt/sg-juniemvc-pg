  - [x] Include methods that take beerOrderId as a parameter

- [x] 6.2. Create BeerOrderShipmentServiceImpl
  - [x] Create a new service implementation `BeerOrderShipmentServiceImpl` in the `guru.springframework.juniemvc.services` package
  - [x] Implement the BeerOrderShipmentService interface

  - [x] Add proper error handling and validation

## 7. Create Controller
- [x] 7.1. Create BeerOrderShipmentController
  - [x] Create a new controller `BeerOrderShipmentController` in the `guru.springframework.juniemvc.controllers` package
  - [x] Use the path "/api/v1/beer-orders/{beerOrderId}/shipments" as specified in requirements
  - [x] Implement CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - [x] Use proper HTTP status codes and response entities
  - [x] Add validation for request bodies

## 8. Create Tests
